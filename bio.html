      About me
    </h2>
    <p>
      I'm a geographer and public health researcher who illuminates health 
      inequities using statistical modeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love mixed-methods research and have developed successful projects 
      alongside clinicians, public administrators, nonprofits, and qualitative
      social scientists. If you have similar interests and an idea for a project,
      please <a href='/contact.html'>send me an email or connect on social media</a>.
