title: "Mapping child mortality across low- and middle-income countries"
date: 2019-10-16
info: >-
  We map the effort to eliminate child mortality at the district level across 
  99 low- and middle-income countries, tracking 123 million child deaths between
  2000 and 2017. While substantial progress has been made across nearly all
  countries, we found that 58% of deaths during this time could have been
  averted in the absence of within-country inequality.
