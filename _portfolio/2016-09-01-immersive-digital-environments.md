  Working with GIS researchers at The Ohio State University and UC Santa Barbara, 
  I developed a process for representing real-world landscapes in an interactive 
  3D format that can be shared and viewed in VR, allowing for viewers to engage 
  with distant places and environments.

# Creating immersive digital landscapes using computer vision

### Sharing places

Starting in the summer of 2014, I developed a method for digitizing real-world landscapes as interactive 3D virtual environments. This method recreates the sights and sounds of a place, then allows users to navigate and interact with the environment as if they were actually _in situ_. Using only a kite, a camera, and a few easy-to-use software packages, anyone can record their experiences of a landscape and share them with others as easily as they might share an image or a video.

This project builds on the research of [Kitty Currier](https://kittycurrier.com/), a PhD candidate in Geography at UC Santa Barbara. By using a kite to take aerial photographs and then processing those photographs with computer vision software, Kitty produced a low-cost, high-resolution [3D model](http://geog.ucsb.edu/~currier/files/paper_2014_jom.pdf) of an Indonesian island. I have extended Kitty's process by representing the 3D model within a video game engine and thoroughly documented my work flow so that it can be replicated by anyone, regardless of technical background.

### Demo

You can download and test my recreation of Santa Barbara's Campus Point cliffs **[here](http://tiny.cc/geogames_env)** _(warning: large file download)_. The full process is documented in a [chapter](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathaniel_Henry/publication/301796345_A_Cost-effective_Workflow_for_Depicting_Landscapes_in_Immersive_Virtual_Environments/links/5728ae0908aef5d48d2c8053/A-Cost-effective-Workflow-for-Depicting-Landscapes-in-Immersive-Virtual-Environments.pdf) of the book [Geogames and Geoplay](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-22774-0) (Springer, 2018).
