  3D format that can be shared and viewed in VR, allowing for viewers to engage 
  with distant places and environments.

# Creating immersive digital landscapes using computer vision

Based on work at the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center in UC Santa Barbara, I
developed a method for digitizing real-world landscapes as interactive 3D
virtual environments. This method recreates the sights and sounds of a place,
then allows users to navigate and interact with the environment as if they were
actually _in situ_. Using only a kite, a camera, and a few easy-to-use software
packages, anyone can record their experiences of a landscape and share them with
others as easily as they might share an image or a video.

This project builds on the research of [Kitty
Currier](https://kittycurrier.com/), a PhD candidate in Geography at UC Santa
Barbara. By using a kite to take aerial photographs and then processing those
photographs with computer vision software, Kitty produced a low-cost,
high-resolution [3D
model](http://geog.ucsb.edu/~currier/files/paper_2014_jom.pdf) of an Indonesian
island. I have extended Kitty's process by representing the 3D model within a
video game engine and thoroughly documented my work flow so that it can be
replicated by anyone, regardless of technical background.

## Demo

You can download and test my recreation of Santa Barbara's Campus Point cliffs
**[here](http://tiny.cc/geogames_env)** _(warning: large file download)_. The
full process is documented in a
[chapter](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathaniel_Henry/publication/301796345_A_Cost-effective_Workflow_for_Depicting_Landscapes_in_Immersive_Virtual_Environments/links/5728ae0908aef5d48d2c8053/A-Cost-effective-Workflow-for-Depicting-Landscapes-in-Immersive-Virtual-Environments.pdf)
of the book [Geogames and
Geoplay](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-22774-0) (Springer,
2018).

Downloading and opening the landscape is easy:

 - Click on the link above to download the compressed game file
 - Unzip the compressed file
 - Open the folder and double-click on UC_Santa_Barbara_Cliffs.exe to view the landscape.


### Navigating the Virtual Environment
    
Once the game is open, you will be able to explore the Campus Point cliffs at
the University of California, Santa Barbara. Use the following controls to
navigate:

 - Move the mouse to look around
 - Press the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to move forwards, left, backwards, and right
 - Press the `Q` and `E` keys to move upwards and downwards
 - Press `Alt + Tab` to switch out of the window
 - Press `Alt + F4` to close the window
 - For users with a VR headset, simply plug the headset into your computer on 
   Extended Desktop mode to view the landscape in VR.
